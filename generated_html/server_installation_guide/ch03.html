                                        and DBMgr), and you are using secondary databases, you will need to
                                        use LVM partitions and you will also need to allocate some free
                                        space for the LVM snapshot. You can add unallocated space on one of

                        </p>
                        <p>BigWorld components assume that the username to UID mapping is
                                   unique across the network i.e. two users with the same name on two
                                   different machines will have the same UID and vice versa. If you are
                                   creating accounts with the same name on multiple machines, please
                                   ensure that they all have the UID by manually specifying their
                                   UID.
                        </p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the BigWorld server also assumes that server
                                   components started by the same user (as identified by their UID)
                                   belongs to the same server instance, even when those components are
                                   running on different machines. To run multiple BigWorld Server
                                   instances, multiple user accounts are needed.
                        </p>
                        <p>You can set up remote account information servers such as LDAP.
                                   We recommend using LDAP during development to ensure that every
                                   machine in the cluster has the same user set. Typically, each
                                   developer user has an account where they can run their own servers
                                   independent of other users.
                        </p>
                        <p>Refer to the OpenLDAP documentation for further information on
                                   how to configure an LDAP service to authenticate users.

                        <p>For a development machine, the firewall should be disabled. The
                                   default firewall blocks all UDP traffic, which prevents the BigWorld
                                   Server from operating. You can disable the firewall by setting the
                                   <span class="literal">Security Level</span> option to
                                   <span class="literal">Disabled</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p>For a production machine, you will need to setup specialised

                        <p>For production machines, in order to avoid unexpected load
                                   spikes on your system from background services, we recommend that you
                                   disable any non-essential services. You can configure which services
                                   are started up at boot time.
